# Compiling C files with gcc
Tools used include Shell, terminal emulator, vi and Nano.
# Compilation
Compilation is the translation of source code (the code we write) into object code (sequence of statements in machine language) by a compiler.

The compilation process has four different steps:

- The preprocessing
- The compiling
- The assembling
- The linking
The compiler we will be using as an example is gcc which stands for GNU Compiler Collection. The GNU project is an free-software and mass-collaboration project launched by Richard Stallman in 1983, allowing developers to have access to powerful tools for free.
